# 04-Challenge-Code-Quiz

## Description
An application that challenges the user with JavaScript-related quiz questions within a 90 second time limit and tallies the user's score. The application utilizes JavaScript scripts and a Bulma css framework.

## Usage
The user is presented with a coding quiz, and once the quiz has begun they have 90 seconds to complete it. The user will be penalized by 10 points and have 10 seconds taken off the current time if they choose an incorrect answer to a question. They will gain 10 points for every correct answer they choose, and once the questions have all been answered or time has expired then the quiz will end. At the end of the quiz the user's score will be tallied up. Then that total will be saved to local storage 
and displayed on the page even if the page is reloaded.
